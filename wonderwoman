Wonder Woman, known also as Diana of Themyscira, was the princess of the Amazons and one of the original seven founders of the Justice League. She was exiled after bringing outsiders to Themyscira, but was later welcomed back and made ambassador for her home.
Diana began life as a clay sculpture. Her mother, Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, breathed life into her so that she might have a child of her own. Diana was later told that she had been sculpted from clay by not just her mother, but also by her mother's lover, Hades. Diana chose not to challenge this information, because she "knew who raised [her].
Diana took on the name Wonder Woman and continued to serve with the League, working on missions such as assisting Aquaman in keeping control of Atlantis from his brother.However, eight months after the League's formation, Diana began to have second thoughts about leaving her mother and sisters. Believing that she at least owed Hippolyta an explanation for her actions, Diana decided to return to Themyscira.
Diana participated in the expansion of the Justice League, eventually moving on board the new Watchtower.She even acquired an invisible jet for her own use.As the League grew to include over sixty new members, Diana served on the League's founding council and as a mission leader.
Diana was "blessed by the gods" with amazing speed and strength. She also possessed the power of flight, silver bracelets that could deflect all sorts of projectiles, and an indestructible golden lasso. She wore "armor" created by the Greek god, Hephaestus. Initially, the armor was taken by Diana without permission, and thus it was some time before Diana became aware of its additional potential.
Some continuity problems exist as Wonder Woman was mentioned by Lois Lane in "Blasts From the Past, Part I" though Diana had yet to begin her crime-fighting career at that time. When Diana made her first appearance in "Secret Origins", she was unknown to the other heroes.
