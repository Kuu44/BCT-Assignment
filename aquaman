For years, Aquaman was considered an urban legend, until he was kidnapped and caged by Lex Luthor. He called out, telepathically, to all sea creatures to attack the "surface dwellers." The attack was stopped by Lois Lane, with the help of Superman.
Aquaman arrived first to help and save civilians from magma creatures and to prevent an oil spill. He also criticized humans for their stupidity for not considering the possibilities there would be creatures living in the magma chamber they drilled into.
As an Atlantean, Aquaman was both stronger and tougher than ordinary human beings, and could breathe underwater as well as in the air.
His strength was of the level where he could knock out opponents with just one blow (as demonstrated by how he knocked out John Stewart), break metal chains, and even hold his own against Wonder Woman in a physical fight.
He also seemed to possess superhuman durability, given how his skin was difficult to pierce, and described to be "tougher than a rhino's". However, Superman was still capable of easily knocking him out with just one punch.
Aquaman's most powerful ability was, perhaps, his ability to telepathically communicate with marine life, which enabled him to sense impending threats to his kingdom as well as to summon marine creatures to aid him in battle
As the King of Atlantis, Aquaman wielded the Trident of Poseidon, which endowed him with great magical powers. It was also possible that his kingly status made him either highly resistant or even immune to water-based attacks, given how Downpour's hydrokinetic attacks left no visible damage on him at all.
